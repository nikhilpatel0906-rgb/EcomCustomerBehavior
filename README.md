# E-Commerce Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

An end-to-end **Data Analytics Project** analyzing 12,000+ website user sessions to understand why visitors browse but do not purchase and how an e-commerce business can improve conversion rate.

* Which users should be targeted
* How to improve sales conversion

## Project Objective

Identify behavioral patterns affecting purchase decisions and provide actionable business strategies to increase conversion rate without increasing marketing spending.

* **Excel** : KPI & initial analysis
* **SQL** : Business queries & segmentation
* **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** : Exploratory Data Analysis
